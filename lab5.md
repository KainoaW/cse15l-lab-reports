**Lab 5**

**Part 1:**
Student Bug:

*What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?*

I am using Visual Studios Code on a Mac.

*Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.*



*Detail the failure-inducing input and context. That might mean any or all of the command you're running, a test case, command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran. Do your best to provide as much context as you can.*

**Part 2:**

During labs I was able to get a hands on experience with the topics that we learned in lecture. The biggest aspect of this was learning how to engage with files without using Visual Studios. I did not think it was possible to run these files, but with vim and the terminal it is. Labs gave me the opportunity to practice vim and learn more of the applications and customization of it.
